# Youtube_Clone1

YouTube clone with HTML and CSS




Description
Built this project to test my knowledge on embedding images and videos in a webpage.
Also wanted to see how well my understanding of CSS grid layouts is
Also applied some BEM in the styling to apply my learning knowledge of that too.
